"""
Request scheduling strategies for controlling benchmark request processing patterns.

Provides timing implementations and concrete strategies that control request
concurrency, timing patterns, and throughput characteristics to simulate real-world
usage scenarios. Strategies define how requests are distributed across worker processes,
when they should be scheduled, and what constraints apply to concurrent processing.
The scheduling system separates timing logic from strategy constraints, enabling
flexible combination of timing behaviors with process and concurrency limits.
