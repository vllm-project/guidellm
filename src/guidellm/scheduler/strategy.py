Request scheduling strategies for controlling how benchmark requests are processed.

This module provides timing implementations and concrete strategies that control request
concurrency, timing patterns, and throughput characteristics to simulate real-world
usage scenarios. The scheduling system separates timing logic from strategy constraints,
enabling flexible combination of timing behaviors with process and concurrency limits.
