"""
Report container for multiple generative benchmark results with persistence.

Provides data structures for aggregating multiple benchmark executions into a single
report with file I/O capabilities. Supports loading and saving benchmark collections
in JSON and YAML formats, enabling result persistence, sharing, and analysis across
different execution sessions. Core functionality includes benchmark grouping with
shared configuration parameters and flexible file path resolution.
