"""
Registry of per-modality parsers for non-text output embedded in chat
completion responses (message.content list items, message.audio, etc.).

Each phase (audio, image, video) registers exactly one parser for its
modality here and never touches the other phases' registrations or the
dispatch logic below. This keeps "what modalities does this build of
GuideLLM understand" a pure function of which phases have landed, with zero
shared code to merge-conflict on.
