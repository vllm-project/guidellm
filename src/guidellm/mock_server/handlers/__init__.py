HTTP request handlers for the GuideLLM mock server.

This module exposes request handlers that implement OpenAI-compatible API endpoints
for the mock server. The handlers provide realistic LLM simulation capabilities
including chat completions, legacy completions, and tokenization services with
configurable timing characteristics, token counting, and proper error handling to
support comprehensive benchmarking and testing scenarios.
